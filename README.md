 Video on how to install (well for port forwarding n stuff) Coming Soon
 
 Notes:
 This script is working with Ubuntu (or Debain, only tested in Ubuntu)
 -
 This script does not do the port forwarding on the Router end
 -
 <strong> this script OVERWRITES anything in the folders /etc/apache2 and /var/www/</strong>.
 -
 If you need more then 2 sites a Script with upto 5 sites will be coming within the year.
 -
 if you are using just 1 site, Just Fill out the 2nd one with Example.com (dummy site and wont be used)
 -
 Make sure you Right click and make file an executable or the script will NEVER work.
 -
 for your site. Replace the Index file with your Site. (ex: /var/www/yoursite.com/public_html/*put your website files here*) 
 you also need to stop the Apache service (sudo service apache2 stop) and put in the files then Turn on Apache (sudo service apache2 start)

 hope you enjoy -n
